## Description 
A fun quiz to use to compete against friends. This is created primarily with Javascript. It has a basic structure in HTML and some slight styling in CSS, but everything else is Javascript. The user will have a landing page that lets them start the quiz or check out the highscores. The highscores are stored locally at the moment. Starting the quiz will cause the time to count down and they will go through an array of questions, wrong answer will decrease the timer by 10. Once, they finish the quiz or the time runs out they are asked to submit their intials to be into the hall of fame. 

    Going forward I would like to add more questions and add some more styling. I would also like to have the scores be stored globally so that people could compete amongst friends. Adding in some animations if a user claims the top spot would be also be a nice touch.
